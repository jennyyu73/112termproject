Jifeng Yu (jifengy) TP

To play the game, just run the "TP main.py" file as a script.
No additional modules need to be downloaded, all you need is Python 3 and a compiler.
Note: This game will not work on Mac computers, because Tkinter does not allow .png
files to be used on Mac OS. The game only works on Windows because all the image files are 
.png, not .gif.
